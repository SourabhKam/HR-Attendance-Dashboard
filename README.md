# This Dashbord For HR check how many employee work on WFO,
WFH, Half day Leave without pay HR will find perticuler employee
I found the WFH employee choose only in May 2022 because of COVID19 and some of employee give a sick leave 
I found most of the employee work on Monday because of work load 
and most of the employee will work on WFH only on Friday because of Saturday and Sunday in Holiday.
